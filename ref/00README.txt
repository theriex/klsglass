Pic files to be displayed on the website are copied over from the general
photo files archive by naming convention.  The marker is 
            "kga" (k)aren (g)lass (a)rt + 
            medium code: (s)tained (b)lown (f)used
    YYYYMMDD_kga[sbf]_URISafeName.jpg

Pic files are copied over to gpics, and pfps.js gets written using copypics:
node copypics.js delete  # delete pic files and pfps.js
node copypics.js
